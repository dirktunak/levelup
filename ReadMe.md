# LevelUp
## Overview
[Sheng Ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji)
This is the 5 player version of Sheng Ji.
The game is played in a series of rounds.
Everyone starts at **level 2**.  
Every round has a 
* **Trump Suit**: defined during the **deal**
* **Trump Rank**: equivalent to the  **champion's level**

Teams are dynamic and change every round.
* **Defending team**: 2 people, **Champion** and **partner**
*  **Offensive team**: The 3 other players

The game revolves around how many points the **Offensive** team wins in a round.  The **defending** team does not need to keep track of their points, only the **offensive** team.

The point cards are as follows
* **5**: 5 points
* **10**: 10 points
* **K**: 10 points

Thus there are 25 points per suit, and since there are 4 suits per deck and 2 decks there are **200 points**.

## Scoring

| Offensive team points | Score        | Champion Change? |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 0                     | Defenders +3 |       No         |
| 5-35                  | Defenders +2 |       No         |
| 40-75                 | Defenders +1 |       No         |
| 80-115                | None         |       Yes        |
| 120-155               | Offensive +1 |       Yes        |
| 160-195               | Offensive +2 |       Yes        |
| 200-235               | Offensive +3 |       Yes        |
| 240-275               | Offensive +4 |       Yes        |
| 280                   | Offensive +5 |       Yes        |

When the **champion** changes it goes to the next person counter-clockwise.
It will skip the **champion's partner** if they are the next person, since they were on the losing team.

## Card Strengths
The ordering of the cards depends on the **Trump Suit and Rank**.  The typical order, from highest to lowest, is: 
1. Red Jokers (Big Jokers)
2. Black Jokers(Small Jokers)
3. Cards in both **Trump Suit** and **Rank**
4. Cards in **Trump Rank**
5. Cards in **Trump Suit** following descending order Ace through 2
6. Cards in other suits, following descending order Ace through 2


For example, if **Trump Suit and Rank** is 3♠
1. Red Jokers (Big Jokers)
2. Black Jokers (Small Jokers)
3. 3♠
4. 3 of other suits
5. A♠-4♠, 2♠
6. Cards in other suits, following the order  **A**-**4**, **2**

## Dealing
Two decks with jokers (108 total cards, 54 from each deck)
Decks are shuffled together and placed in center
Each player draws one card at a time, starting left of the dealer and continuing **counter-clockwise until there are 8 cards left**.

### First round
Since no one is **champion** at the beginning of the game, the **trump rank is 2**.
The **champion** for the round will be the player who's flip ultimately determines the **trump suit**.
### Flip
At any time a player can reveal a card of the **trump rank** to determine the **trump suit** for the round.  This player can strengthen their flip by revealing their flip's pair.
### Outflip
A player can outflip a single card flip and change the **trump suit** by revealing a pair of cards of the **trump rank**.  A player cannot outflip themselves, nor can they outflip a pair of cards in the **trump rank**.
### Joker flip
A pair of jokers can be flipped to set **no trump suit**.  Only a pair can be flipped and outflips a pair of cards in the **trump rank**.
### No flip
If no one has flipped by the time the **bottom 8** have been reached, flip over the top card from the **bottom 8** to determine the **trump suit**.  If it is a joker, flip over another.
### Bottom 8
The **champion** picks up the **bottom 8** cards, integrates these cards into their hand, and discards 8 cards back into the middle.  Once the champion looks at the **bottom 8** they cannot outflip.  The team that **wins** the **last trick** wins **double all the points in the bottom 8**.  Thus it is possible to score **280** if 80 points are put in the **bottom 8**.

## Champion's Partner

After setting the **bottom 8**, the **champion** will now "call a partner".
The **champion** will call for either **first** or **other** of a **non-trump** card.
**First** is used when the **champion** does not have one of the called card.
**Other** is used if the **champion** does have the other one.
The **champion** may also elect to **1v4**.  The **champion** will earn twice as many levels as they would have normally.

Example:
**Trump Rank: 6, Trump Suit: ♠**
**Champion** can call **2-5, 7-A** of **♣, ♦ or ♥**.
Cannot call any **6, ♠ or Joker** since they are all part of the trump suit.
If the **champion** has an **A♣**, they cannot call **First A♣**.  They must instead call **Other A♣** since the **champion** owns the other of the called card.
## Play
The **champion** starts the first trick of the round, afterwards the winner of the previous trick starts the next one.
There are 4 types of plays, **single**, **pair**, **consecutive pair**, and **highest**.
### Single
A single card is played by the trick starter to lead the trick.  Each other player **must follow suit** if they have cards in the same suit.  If a trump card is lead, the other players must play a trump card if they have any.  The highest trump, or if no trumps are played, the highest-ordered card of the suit lead takes the trick.  In cases of ties, the card played first wins.
### Pair
The two cards must be *identical*.  A **Q♠** and **Q♣** are not identical and are therefore not a pair, despite sharing the same rank.
Other players must follow suit by playing cards according to the following priority

-   Other pairs in the lead suit
-   Other singles in the lead suit

If a player has no cards in the lead suit, only then can they play a pair of trumps.

### Consecutive Pairs
If a player has a consecutive pair of cards in the same suit, they may lead it as a group.
Other players must follow suit by playing cards according to the following priority
 * Other consecutive pairs in the lead suit
 * Other pairs in the lead suit
 * Other singles in the lead suit

If a player has no cards in the lead suit, only then can they play a consecutive pair of trumps.

Examples of consecutive pairs given Trump Suit and Rank are **7♣**

| Cards Lead                    | Consecutive Pairs?                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5♠-5♠-4♠-4♠                   | Yes                                                                          |
| A♦-A♦-K♦-K♦-Q♦-Q♦             | Yes, triple consecutive                                                      |
| 4♣-4♣-3♣-3♣                   | Yes, consecutive pair in Trump                                               |
| 8♥-8♥-6♥-6♥                   | Yes, when 7 is trump, 8 and 6 become consecutive                             |
| 7♣-7♣-7♠-7♠-A♣-A♣             | Yes, order of cards follow 7♣-7(other suits)-A♣                              |
| Black Joker-Black Joker-7♣-7♣ | Yes                                                                          |
| 7♠-7♠-7♦-7♦                   | Yes, 7(other suits) are consecutive with each other                          |
| Red Joker-Red Joker-7♣-7♣     | No, order of jokers is Red Joker-Black Joker-7♣                              |
| 7♠-7♠-6♠-6♠                   | No, 7♠ is part of the trump suit, not ♠ suit.                                |
| 7♣-7♣-8♣-8♣                   | No, since 7♣ is Trump Rank and Suit, it is just below the Jokers in strength |

### Highest
A player can mix and match singles, pairs and consecutive pairs of the same suit in a **Highest** play.
When a player beings a highest play, each other play **must** check if they can beat any part of the play **in its suit**.  If any part can be beat, as a penalty, the lead player must take back the play and only lead with the cards that can be beat.

When **Trumps** are played to beat out a **Highest** play, a player must play a hand that beats every part of the **Highest** play.  If a Single and Consecutive pair are played, then a player has to beat both the Single and Consecutive Pair in **Trump**.  To evaluate two **Trump** plays, look at the most difficult category of play, ie. Consecutives > Pairs > Singles.
Examples of **Highest** given Trump Suit and Rank are **7♣**
| Cards Lead       | Other players play                  | Remarks                                                                                                                                               |

| K♦-Q♦            |          d                          | Can only be played if both A♦s and the other K♦ have been played. The 2nd Q♦ will be beat because it is the 2nd one played                            |
