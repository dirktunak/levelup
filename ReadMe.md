# LevelUp
## Overview

*12 minute read*

[Sheng Ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji)

This is the 5 player version of Sheng Ji.

The game is played in a series of rounds.

Everyone starts at **level 2**.  

Every round has a 
* **Trump Suit**: defined during the **deal**
* **Trump Rank**: equivalent to the  **champion's level**

Teams are dynamic and change every round.
* **Defending team**: 2 people, **Champion** and **partner**
* **Offensive team**: The 3 other players

The game revolves around how many points the **Offensive** team wins in a round.  The **Defending** team does not need to keep track of their points.

The point cards are as follows
* **5** : 5 points
* **10**: 10 points
* **K** : 10 points

Thus there are 25 points per suit, and since there are 4 suits per deck and 2 decks there are **200 points**.

## Scoring

| Offensive team points | Score        | Champion Change? |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 0                     | Defenders +3 |       No         |
| 5-35                  | Defenders +2 |       No         |
| 40-75                 | Defenders +1 |       No         |
| 80-115                | None         |       Yes        |
| 120-155               | Offensive +1 |       Yes        |
| 160-195               | Offensive +2 |       Yes        |
| 200-235               | Offensive +3 |       Yes        |
| 240-275               | Offensive +4 |       Yes        |
| 280                   | Offensive +5 |       Yes        |

When the **champion** changes it goes to the next person counter-clockwise.

It will skip the **champion's partner** if they are the next person, since they were on the losing team.

## Card Strengths
A cards strength depends on the **Trump Suit and Rank**.  The typical order, from highest to lowest, is: 
1. Red Jokers (Big Jokers)
2. Black Jokers(Small Jokers)
3. Cards in both **Trump Suit** and **Trump Rank**
4. Cards in **Trump Rank**
5. Cards in **Trump Suit** following descending order Ace through 2
6. Cards in other suits, following descending order Ace through 2


For example, if **Trump Suit and Rank** is 3♠
1. Red Jokers (Big Jokers)
2. Black Jokers (Small Jokers)
3. 3♠
4. 3 of other suits
5. A♠-4♠, 2♠
6. Cards in other suits, following the order  **A**-**4**, **2**

## Dealing
Two decks with jokers (108 total cards, 54 from each deck)

Decks are shuffled together and placed in center

Each player draws one card at a time, starting right of the dealer and continuing **counter-clockwise until there are 8 cards left**.

### First round
Since no one is **champion** at the beginning of the game, the **trump rank is 2**.

The **champion** for the round will be the player who's flip ultimately determines the **trump suit**.

### Flip
At any time a player can reveal a card of the **trump rank** to determine the **trump suit** for the round.  

This player can strengthen their flip by revealing their flip's pair.
### Outflip
A player can outflip a single card flip and change the **trump suit** by revealing a pair of cards of the **trump rank**.  

A player cannot outflip themselves, nor can they outflip a pair of cards in the **trump rank**.
### Joker flip
A pair of jokers can be flipped to set **no trump suit**.  

Only a pair can be flipped and a joker outflip beats everything.
### No flip
If no one has flipped by the time the **bottom 8** have been reached, flip over the top card from the **bottom 8** to determine the **trump suit**.  If it is a joker, flip over another.
### Bottom 8
The **champion** picks up the **bottom 8** cards, integrates these cards into their hand, and discards 8 cards back into the middle.  

Once the champion looks at the **bottom 8** they cannot outflip.  

The team that **wins** the **last trick** wins **double all the points in the bottom 8**.  

Thus it is possible to score **280** if 80 points are put in the **bottom 8**.

## Champion's Partner

After setting the **bottom 8**, the **champion** will now "call a partner".

The **champion** will call for either **first** or **other** of a **non-trump** card.

**First** is used when the **champion** does not have one of the called card.

**Other** is used if the **champion** does have the other one.

The **champion** may also elect to **1v4**.  The **champion** will earn twice as many levels as they would have normally.


Example:
**Trump Rank: 6, Trump Suit: ♠**
**Champion** can call **2-5, 7-A** of **♣, ♦ or ♥**.

Cannot call any **6, ♠ or Joker** since they are all part of the trump suit.

If the **champion** has an **A♣**, they cannot call **First A♣**.  They must instead call **Other A♣** since the **champion** owns the other of the called card.

## Play
The **champion** starts the first trick of the round, afterwards the winner of the previous trick starts the next one.

The winner of the trick wins all the points in that trick, if there are any.

There are 4 types of plays, **single**, **pair**, **consecutive pair**, and **highest**.
### Single
A single card is played by the trick starter to lead the trick.  

Each other player **must follow suit** if they have cards in the same suit.  

If a trump card is lead, the other players must play a trump card if they have any.  

The winner will be the player who played the highest trump or highest card in the lead suit.

In cases of ties, the card played first wins.
### Pair
The two cards must be *identical*.  A **Q♠** and **Q♣** are not identical and are therefore not a pair, despite sharing the same rank.

Other players must follow suit by playing cards according to the following priority

-   Other pairs in the lead suit
-   Other singles in the lead suit

If a player has no cards in the lead suit, only then can they play a pair of trumps.

### Consecutive Pairs
If a player has a consecutive pair of cards in the same suit, they may lead it as a group.

Other players must follow suit by playing cards according to the following priority
 * Other consecutive pairs in the lead suit
 * Other pairs in the lead suit
 * Other singles in the lead suit

If a player has no cards in the lead suit, only then can they play a consecutive pair of trumps.

Examples of consecutive pairs given Trump Suit and Rank are **7♣**

| Cards Lead                    | Consecutive Pairs?                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5♠-5♠-4♠-4♠                   | Yes                                                                          |
| A♦-A♦-K♦-K♦-Q♦-Q♦             | Yes, triple consecutive                                                      |
| 4♣-4♣-3♣-3♣                   | Yes, consecutive pair in Trump                                               |
| 8♥-8♥-6♥-6♥                   | Yes, when 7 is trump, 8 and 6 become consecutive                             |
| 7♣-7♣-7♠-7♠-A♣-A♣             | Yes, order of cards follow 7♣-7(other suits)-A♣                              |
| Black Joker-Black Joker-7♣-7♣ | Yes                                                                          |
| 7♠-7♠-7♦-7♦                   | Yes, 7(other suits) are consecutive with each other                          |
| Red Joker-Red Joker-7♣-7♣     | No, order of jokers is Red Joker-Black Joker-7♣                              |
| 7♠-7♠-6♠-6♠                   | No, 7♠ is part of the trump suit, not ♠ suit.                                |
| 7♣-7♣-8♣-8♣                   | No, since 7♣ is Trump Rank and Suit, it is just below the Jokers in strength |

### Highest
A player can mix and match singles, pairs and consecutive pairs of the same suit in a **Highest** play.

When a player beings a highest play, each other play **must** check if they can beat any part of the play **in its suit**.  If any part can be beat, as a penalty, the lead player must take back the play and only lead with the cards that can be beat.

When **Trumps** are played to beat out a **Highest** play, a player must play a hand that beats every part of the **Highest** play.  If a Single and Consecutive pair are played, then a player has to beat both the Single and Consecutive Pair in **Trump**.  To evaluate two **Trump** plays, look at the most difficult category of play, ie. Consecutives > Pairs > Singles.

Examples of **Highest** given Trump Suit and Rank are **7♣**

| Cards Lead       | Other players play                 | Remarks                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| K♦-Q♦            |                                    | Can only be played if both A♦s and the other K♦ have been played. The 2nd Q♦ will be beat because it is the 2nd one played                            |
|                  | 5♣-5♣ <br> 10♣- 3♣                 | Since the lead was for two singles, the highest single will win.  The player that played 10♣ will win, despite a pair of 5♣ being played              |
| K♠-Q♠-Q♠-10♠-10♠ |                                    | Can only be played if there are no more A♠s, and no one has a pair of J♠s                                                                             |
|                  | 3♣-9♣-9♣-2♣-2♣ <br> A♣-6♣-6♣-5♣-5♣ | First player wins.  The most difficult category is a Pair, so the 9♣ pair is the highest, despite the 2nd player having the A♣ and a consecutive pair |
| A♥-3♥-3♥-2♥-2♥   |                                    | Can only be played if no other player can be the 3♥-2♥ consecutive pair                                                                               |
|                  | 3♣-9♣-9♣-2♣-2♣ <br> A♣-6♣-6♣-5♣-5♣ | Second player wins.  The first player does not have a consecutive pair, and does not beat the original play                                           |
| A♦-K♦-K♦         |                                    | This is guaranteed highest in the suit                                                                                                                |
|                  | 7♥-7♥-2♣ <br> 7♠-7♠-5♣             | Since the two pairs of **7**s are equivalent, the first one played will win, regardless of the strength of the single trump                           |

## Suggestions and Tips

### How to organize your cards

You should be very methodical with how you order your cards.  It will make the game easier to play.

Given **Trump Suit and Rank**: 7♣

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7♣ | 7♥ | 7♥ | BigJoker | SmallJoker | A♣ | K♣ | J♣ | 10♣ | 3♣ | 2♣ | K♥ | 3♥ | A♠ | Q♠ | Q♠ | 10♦ | 8♦ | 6♦ | 2♦ |

You may wish to move point cards to the front or back of a suit but I find this unnecessary after having played for so long.  

I highly suggest swapping between red and black suits so that you are less likely to misread a suit.

### 1v4
You should only 1v4 if you can win every hand and 6x level

The second you lose a hand you will not have a good time

### Bottom 8, and calling a card
These two go hand in hand. As the champion you will be commanding the game.  You should short a suit.  If you think you have a very good hand, you may think about putting points on the bottom.

You should call either an Ace, King or possibly a 10 in a suit.  
You want your partner to quickly reveal themselves, and to either win a hand that you start with points, or throw points onto a hand you are winning.

For example, if you have a King and 10 in a suit, you may want to call **First Ace**.  Play your King first.  No one should play an Ace since if they do, they are on your team, and have not changed the fact that your team is winning the hand.  Then you can follow up with the 10 and have them play the Ace, killing another 10 points.  I would normally short the rest of this suit, since it is an agreed upon strategy within my group of friends and makes it easy for **champions partner** to know which suit is safe to play, since you can play trumps to ensure the hand is won.

It is preferable to call **other** instead of **first** in case you get wrecked early on and your two potential partners are hoping to not be on your team.  You can usually expect to be able to get away with 1 or 2 cards in a suit before someone will be out, depends on how many you have of that suit.
